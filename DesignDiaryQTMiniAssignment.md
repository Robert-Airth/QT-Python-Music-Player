# Design Diary - QT Python Music Player

At the beginning of this assignment, I made good progress on the UI and I had a pretty clear
understanding of how the logic ought to be to make it work correctly. As I dug deeper into the
QtMediaPlayer documentation, I got increasingly confused. It seemed easy enough to be able to
achieve what I desired, but every time I tried something I ended up getting no where. Signals
weren't triggering correctly, functions weren't behaving the way I anticipated based on the
documentation, and my confidence in my understanding of the syntax/heirarchy/scope of Python
code diminished. I just kept: researching, getting confused, checking Jordan Abbott's code, and
getting my logic working without a good understanding of why it was working. It was quite 
frustrating and I'm hoping I have an epiphany about it all soon. It is pretty frustrating that a 
widely accepted high-level language is giving me so much trouble. I am not happy
with my finished product but I do think I met the base objectives for the assignment.
